# ionic-transparent-sidemenu

When developing an ionic app, I find that side menu is very hard to customize. 
The menu content will move to the right when clicking side-menu button, unlike most modern app which set the content to transparent without moving the content to one side.
However, I couldn't find any good solutions on the internet, most of the people say I need to change the library of ionic itself.
I fork the repository from codepen, which has a customized side-menu, but it differs from what I intend to create. 
Thus I tweak it a little bit, to create this app, which when clicking side-menu button, the content will stay but become transparent and the menu will be on top of the content. 




Forked from [Secret Sam](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbOeyz)'s Pen [Ionic Side Menu and Navigation: 0.9.24](http://codepen.io/vialware/pen/ypoxd/).
